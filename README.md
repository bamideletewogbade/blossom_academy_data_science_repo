# Data Science Class Project

## Overview
This repository contains materials and projects related to my data science class, which I undertook as part of the scholarship program offered by Blossom Academy Africa. Throughout the course, I learned various data science concepts, tools, and techniques, and applied them to real-world projects.

## Contents
The repository is organized as follows:
- **Notebooks**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for different topics covered during the course, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning algorithms, and project implementations.
- **Datasets**: This directory holds datasets used in the projects and exercises.
- **Projects**: Here, you can find complete data science projects that I worked on during the course, along with detailed documentation and analysis.
- **Resources**: Additional resources such as articles, tutorials, and reference materials used for learning and research purposes.

## Projects
- **Project 1: Predictive Modeling for Disease Progression**
  - Description: This project aimed to build a predictive model to predict diabetes disease progression.
  - Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Stats_Model.
  - Notebook: 

- **Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis on [Dataset Name]**
  - Description: This project focused on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and patterns in the dataset.
  - Technologies: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
  - Notebook: 


## Getting Started
To explore the projects and materials in this repository, you can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
